### **$\color{blue}{\textsf{Course Projects}}$**
**Multiple Linear Regression: Model Checking and Diagnostics (Using R)** 
**Guide - Smt. Tanusree Banerjee, Department of Statistics, Bethune College, Kolkata**
   - It is focused on fitting the best multiple linear regression model for the **Energy Efficiency Dataset** obtained from Kaggle.com by detection and removal of influential values. It involves checking of **linearity, whether if the model fitsthe data, possible model inadequacies and normality of residuals**.
   - Through **Cookâ€™s Distance** the influential points are found and then used **DFBETAS** and **DFFITS** Method to check for points having significant influence on the various **estimated parameters** and the **fitted values** respectively. Lastly determining the observations affecting the **general precision** using **COVRATIO** Method.
   - The analysis showed that all observations corresponding the **highest hat values** are **not influential** whereas observations having **less hat values** are **stronger influential points** thus suggesting **leverage points are not always influential**.

**Analysis of various Factors Causing Deaths in Aircraft Accidents (MTH208A)**
**Guide -Dr.Dootika Vats, Department of mathematics and Statistics, IIT Kanpur**
  - Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis** and produced **insightful visualization** to analyze the relationship between the number of casualties and the different parameters of **aircraft accidents** dataset.
  - **Web scraped** the data on aircraft accidents from Wikipedia using **tidyverse** and **rvest** libraries in Rstudio. Then cleaned the data using **stringr**, leaving us with the final data-set containing the record of aircraft accidents happened between 1938 to 2022. Finally presented the work in an interactive web application using the **R shiny web app** feature in R.
  - In terms of **total no. of deaths**, other flight companies had very low figures whereas **Boeing** had the **highest** overall death toll. This is entirely due to Boeing having more flights than any other firm, but if the plot of **fatalities per trip versus company** were not displayed to the general public, they might think Boeing was the most deadly flight company ever existed. According to data, Airbus has more fatalities per trip than Boeing; other airlines are not to far  away.
