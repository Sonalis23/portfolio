### Course Projects
* Multiple Linear Regression: Model Checking and Diagnostics (Using R)
Guide - Smt. Tanusree Banerjee, Department of Statistics, Bethune College, Kolkata
   - It is focused on fitting the best multiple linear regression model for the Energy Efficiency Dataset obtained from Kaggle.com by detection and removal of influential values. It involves checking of linearity, whether if the model fitsthe data, possible model inadequacies and normality of residuals.
   - Through Cookâ€™s Distance the influential points are found and then used DFBETAS and DFFITS Method to check for points having significant influence on the various estimated parameters and the fitted values respectively. Lastly determining the observations affecting the general precision using COVRATIO Method.
   - The analysis showed that all observations corresponding the highest hat values are not influential whereas observations having less hat values are stronger influential points thus suggesting leverage points are not always influential.
